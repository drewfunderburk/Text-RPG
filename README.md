# Welcome to The Game!
This is about as generic as it gets, folks!

### Main Menu
Here you will be given three options:
* Continue
* New Game
* Quit

##### Continue
This option will only work if a save file is found from a previous game. 
If one is found, all of the player's variables as well as the current round number will be loaded back into their respective places.

##### New Game
This option will send the player to character creation where they will be asked for their name.
This could easily be expanded upon in the future to include a combat class or any number of other customizing features.

##### Quit
Quits the game
